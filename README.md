This is an app that mimics a real estate website like Apartments.com and Zillow.com.
It allows the user to filter the listings based on their desired criteria. The 
listings are filtered through the url parameters.  I got the idea on how to do this from Zillow.com.  I also included Google Maps.  The markers are dynamic and clickable.  When the user clicks a certain marker, the listing the same coordinates is highlighted.
